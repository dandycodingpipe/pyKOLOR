# Spectral photon-counting computed tomography (Philips Spectral images)

class Sample:
    """
    The Sample class loads Philips Spectral data and converts the dicom files as numpy 5D arrays: 
        1. Define path and access CT examination study directory 
        2. Pull directory and store studies in a time series (time series dimension)
        3. Extract spectral dicoms and store them in a timepoint class (3d + image decomposition maps are 4 additional dimensions)
    """

class Viewer:
    """
    The Viewer class uses matploblib interactive features to create a 5D image viewer for Spectral data.
