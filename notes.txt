## CNN for analysis

## Elastic database

## image compression

## Loader is Crazy can we make it so if it doesn't see it in the first directory it stops looking?

## Adding database for storing images 
##   - on start up the loader can look in a single directory if there is a new
         folder then iterate through the folder add that to the database

     - is there way we can load images in a more robust way ie get all angles 
            with all time stamps aand store those images in the db. lmk what 
            you think i think this would be a cool way to make it easy to make 
            some of 'gifs' we saw in that gui we looked up
